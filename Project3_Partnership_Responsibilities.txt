Project 3 - Partnership Responsibilities
CSC/CPE 203
Due: November 19, 2025

Team Members: Camnden Mann and Ryan Reeves

==============================================================================

Overall Project Responsibilities:

Camden Mann:
- Implemented the PathingStrategy interface according to assignment specifications
- Created the AStarPathingStrategy class with A* pathfinding algorithm
  * Designed priority queue implementation for open list
  * Implemented closed list using HashSet for visited nodes
  * Developed cost calculation functions (g-cost, h-cost, f-cost)
- Modified Point class to include fCost and gCost fields required for A*
- Configured proper predicates for canPassThrough and withinReach
- Code review and debugging of integration components

Ryan Reeves:
- Implemented path reconstruction logic using parent mapping in A* algorithm
- Added Manhattan distance heuristic function for A* pathfinding
- Integrated PathingStrategy into Dude and Fairy classes
  * Added strategy field initialization
  * Implemented path caching mechanism (currentPath, currentDestination)
  * Modified nextPosition() method to use computePath()
- Created SingleStepPathingStrategy class for initial testing
- Developed PathingTest.java to verify both pathfinding strategies
- Tested A* algorithm with various scenarios:
  * Basic pathfinding from point to point
  * Obstacle avoidance testing
  * Path validation and verification
- Quality assurance, debugging, and prepared project files for submission

==============================================================================

Collaborative Work:
- Both partners worked together on understanding the assignment requirements
- Reviewed and tested the integrated pathfinding in the virtual world
- Verified that entities (Dudes and Fairies) successfully navigate around obstacles
- Ensured all assignment requirements were met before submission

==============================================================================

Summary:
This project successfully implements the Strategy Pattern for pathfinding algorithms,
with a fully functional A* algorithm that allows entities to intelligently navigate
the virtual world while avoiding obstacles. Both partners contributed to ensuring
the code compiles, runs correctly, and meets all assignment specifications.
